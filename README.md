# Private Events


This project is a part of the Odin Project, wherein I have explored advanced active record associations and queries, to create an app where:
1. Users can create private events
2. Users can attend those events
3. Homepage shows the upcoming and past events
4. User's profile shows the events he/she has created alongwith the events he/she has attended in the past and future.
